# Assignment 1
### Linear and polynomial regression

In this assignent a data set of temperatures in Malmslätt, Linköping was given. The task was to perfrom a Bayesian analysis of a quadratic regression $ temp = \beta_0 + \beta_1*time + \beta_2*time^2$. 

First the model parameters for the prior distribution were to be determined. To do this, a conjugate prior for the linear regression model was used. At first we used some given values for the hyperparameters. These resulted in a large variance between different simulations. 

With some trial and error we ended up using the following tuned hyperparameters: $\mu_0 = (-15, 150, -150), \Omega_0 = I_3, \nu_0 = 40, \sigma^2_0 = 1$. This resulted in the following regression curves.
